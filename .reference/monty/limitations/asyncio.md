# `asyncio` module and `async` / `await`

`async def` functions can suspend on `await`, and the host drives long-running
external calls. There is no event loop inside the sandbox; the host is the
loop.

## Module surface

The `asyncio` module exposes exactly two functions:

- `asyncio.run(coro)` — runs a coroutine to completion. Returns the value
  the coroutine `return`s, or re-raises an exception from it.
- `asyncio.gather(*awaitables)` — runs awaitables concurrently and returns
  a list of results. Always behaves as `return_exceptions=False`.
  Any keyword argument is rejected with
  `NotImplementedError: gather() does not yet support keyword arguments`,
  where CPython raises
  `TypeError: gather() got an unexpected keyword argument 'X'` because
  `return_exceptions` is a real kwarg there.

Not implemented (raise `AttributeError`):

`create_task`, `sleep`, `wait`, `wait_for`, `shield`, `to_thread`,
`new_event_loop`, `get_event_loop`, `get_running_loop`, `Queue`, `Lock`,
`Semaphore`, `Event`, `Future`, `Task`, `TaskGroup`, `timeout`,
`timeout_at`, `Timeout`, `as_completed`, `iscoroutine`, `ensure_future`,
the whole `asyncio.subprocess` / `asyncio.streams` / `asyncio.protocols`
surface.

`asyncio.timeout()` / `asyncio.timeout_at()` would be unreachable in any
case: they are async context managers, and `async with` is rejected at parse
time (see ./language.md).

## `async def` / `await`

- `async def` functions and `await` work; coroutines can call each other.
- **Coroutines are single-shot.** Awaiting the same coroutine object twice
  raises `RuntimeError`. Store the *result*, not the coroutine, if you need
  it again.
- `await` on a non-awaitable raises `TypeError`.
- `async for` and `async with` are **rejected at parse time** (see
  ./language.md). Async iteration and async context-manager
  protocols do not exist.
- Async comprehensions (`[x async for x in ...]`) are rejected at parse
  time.
- There is no `__await__` protocol. Awaitables are only the things Monty
  knows internally: coroutines from `async def`, gather futures, and external
  function call futures returned by host bindings.

## Concurrency model

Concurrency is cooperative and host-driven. `gather` suspends Monty whenever
every branch is blocked on an external call, hands the pending calls to the
host, and resumes when the host returns results. There is no preemption, no
threads, and no in-sandbox scheduler.

### A failing `gather` cancels its siblings

When one child of a `gather` raises, every sibling still running is cancelled where it is blocked and never resumes.
That includes the tasks of any gather a sibling was itself awaiting.
CPython leaves those siblings running as tasks on the loop, so:

```python
async def worker():
    for _ in range(3):
        await asyncio.gather(step())
    done.append('finished')
```

appends `'finished'` under CPython after a sibling of `worker()` raises, but not under Monty.

External calls already passed to the host are not cancelled.
The host still resolves them and the results are discarded.
