//! `monty subprocess`: protocol child mode.
//!
//! A thin stdio shell around [`monty_proto::worker::Child`] (the transport-agnostic
//! state machine). Reads framed [`pb::ParentRequest`]s from stdin and writes
//! the [`pb::ChildEvent`]s the child emits to stdout (see `monty-proto` for the
//! schema and protocol rules). The child is strictly turn-based: one request
//! in, zero or more streamed `Print` events out, then exactly one turn-ending
//! event.
//!
//! Crash isolation is the entire point of this mode: the parent must treat a
//! child that exits (or EOFs) *without* a `FatalError` event as crashed —
//! stack overflows and allocator aborts produce no final frame.
//!
//! In this mode stdout carries only protocol frames; diagnostics go to stderr.
