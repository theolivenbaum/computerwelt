/**
 * Mounts a real host directory into the sandbox at a virtual path.
 * Retained overlay data and filesystem results share a per-mount memory
 * budget, `memoryUsageLimit` (100 MB by default).
 *
 * Warning: with `mode: 'read-write'`, files written by sandboxed code persist
 * on the host and are untrusted; do not execute them. Importing counts as
 * executing, and the import can be indirect: Node resolves imports from
 * `node_modules` directories up the tree, so a writable mount inside a project
 * lets sandboxed code shadow a package that has not been loaded yet. Tools
 * also read files without an explicit import: `.git/hooks/*`, `Makefile`,
 * `.env`, CI config. If Python runs against the directory, the same applies to
 * `sys.path` imports; see the `MountDir` docs in the Python package.
 *
 * The `'overlay'` default keeps writes in memory, so nothing reaches the host
 * filesystem. Use `'read-write'` only with a directory that contains no code
 * or config.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const mount = new MountDir({ hostPath: '/path/on/host', virtualPath: '/mnt/data', mode: 'read-only' })
 * await session.feedRun("open('/mnt/data/file.txt').read()", { mount })
 * ```
