/// Convert this crate's Cargo version into a PEP 440 version, e.g.
/// `0.0.19-beta.2` -> `0.0.19b.2` (which PEP 440 normalizes to `0.0.19b2`).
///
/// Copied from `get_pydantic_core_version` in pydantic. Cargo uses `1.0-alpha1`
/// etc. while python uses `1.0.0a1`; this is not full compatibility, but it's
/// good enough for now. The dot after `alpha`/`beta` (e.g. `-alpha.1`) does not
/// need removing, hence why this works.
///
/// See <https://docs.rs/semver/1.0.9/semver/struct.Version.html#method.parse> for
/// the rust spec and <https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/> for the python spec.
///
/// Shared by `lib.rs` (for `pydantic_monty.__version__`) and `build.rs` (for the
/// `pydantic-monty` metapackage's version and exact pins), which `include!`s
/// this file — the two must agree, since the pins have to match the versions
/// maturin builds the client and runtime wheels under.
