// MountDir — immutable mount configuration
// =============================================================================

/// A single mount point mapping a virtual path to a host directory.
///
/// Passing one instance to multiple feeds reuses only its configuration;
/// `'overlay'` writes live in each feed's parent-side mount table.
/// Retained overlay data and filesystem results share a configurable memory
/// budget, which defaults to 100 MB.
///
/// The `mode` controls sandbox access:
/// - `'read-only'` — sandbox can read but not write
/// - `'read-write'` — sandbox can read and write real host files
/// - `'overlay'` — reads fall through to host; writes are captured in memory
///
/// Warning: with `'read-write'`, files written by sandboxed code persist on
/// the host and are untrusted; do not execute them. Importing counts as
/// executing, so a mount of a directory on `sys.path` (including the cwd) lets
/// sandboxed code write `json.py`, or any module not yet imported, and the
/// next `import` runs it. That includes imports made by `pydantic_monty`
/// itself.
