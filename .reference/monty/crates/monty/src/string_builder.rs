//! Resource-tracked builder for `String` values.
//!
//! `StringBuilder` is the canonical way to build a Python-visible string whose
//! final size is not already bounded by an existing input. Operations that grow
//! a `String` in a loop — padding, tab expansion, repetition, container repr,
//! etc. — must use `StringBuilder` rather than unchecked `String` growth. One
//! large reservation could otherwise jump across both allocator limits before
//! execution reaches another checkpoint.
//!
//! # Allocator checks
//!
//! Each capacity increase is preflighted against allocator-backed usage. The
//! in-progress buffer is itself visible to the allocator, including during
//! nested string builds.
//!
//! # Growth policy
//!
//! Capacity doubles on each growth (matching `Vec`'s policy), so an `n`-byte
//! build incurs `O(log n)` tracker calls rather than `O(n)`. Use
//! [`with_capacity`](StringBuilder::with_capacity) when an upper bound is
//! known up front (e.g. padding to a width) — a single check covers every
//! subsequent push. Use [`new`](StringBuilder::new) when the size is
//! not bounded up front.
//!
//! # Two APIs: direct push and `fmt::Write`
//!
//! Callers that build strings imperatively use [`push`](StringBuilder::push)
//! and [`push_str`](StringBuilder::push_str), which return [`ResourceError`]
//! directly. Callers that need to plug into `fmt::Write`-based machinery
//! (`write!`, `format_args!`, the existing `py_repr_fmt` recursion) use the
//! builder's [`fmt::Write`] impl, which captures any [`ResourceError`] into
//! an internal slot since `fmt::Error` is payload-free. The stored error is
//! surfaced automatically by [`finish`](StringBuilder::finish), so the
//! tracker error reaches the caller even when the intermediate
//! `fmt::Error` is swallowed by a downstream formatter.
