# Virtual filesystem

Every Bashkit script runs against an in-memory **virtual filesystem** (VFS), not
the host disk. `cat`, `ls`, `cp`, redirections, `mkdir`, they all work exactly
as a script expects, but the bytes live in memory and disappear when the
interpreter is dropped. Path traversal like `../../../etc/passwd` is normalised
away, and symlinks are stored but never followed. The host is invisible by
default; you grant access deliberately, never by accident.

This is the foundation of the [security model](security.md): there is no real
filesystem to escape to unless you mount one.

## The layering stack

A `Bash` instance composes its filesystem from layers. Each layer wraps the one
below it, so you can stack read-only enforcement, text mounts, and host mounts
over an in-memory base, and swap mounts at runtime.

## Two-layer trait model

Internally the VFS splits raw storage from POSIX semantics:

| Layer | Trait | Responsibility |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Backend | `FsBackend` | Raw storage operations and failure-atomic mutations |
| POSIX | `FileSystem` / `PosixFs` | POSIX-like validation (no duplicate names, type-safe ops, parent-dir rules) |

If you want a custom backend (a database, object store, key-value store),
implement the small `FsBackend` and wrap it in `PosixFs`, the POSIX checks come
for free. Implement `FileSystem` directly only when you need full control over
semantics.

`PosixFs` validates operations before delegating them, but it cannot make a raw
backend mutation atomic. A custom `FsBackend` must make failed `write`, `copy`,
and `rename` operations failure-atomic; a direct `FileSystem` has the same
obligation for `write_file`, `copy`, and `rename`. Errors must leave source and
destination entries, bytes, types, and reported usage unchanged. A wrapper
moving entries between independent backends must restore the previous
destination on failure or reject the move before mutation, usually with
`ErrorKind::CrossesDevices`.

`verify_filesystem_requirements()` is a structural smoke check for root access
and path normalization. It does not mutate the filesystem or certify failure
atomicity, symlink behavior, quota accounting, or error normalization; custom
adapter tests remain responsible for those invariants.

## Built-in implementations

| Implementation | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| **InMemoryFs** | Default (`Bash::new()`). `HashMap`-backed, thread-safe, no persistence. Seeds `/`, `/tmp`, `/home`, `/home/user`, `/dev`. |
| **OverlayFs** | Copy-on-write over another filesystem, with whiteout tracking for deletes. |
| **MountableFs** | Mount multiple filesystems at different paths (longest-prefix match). Always the outermost layer, enabling [live mounts](../crates/bashkit/docs/live_mounts.md). |
| **NamespaceFs** | Compose a static visible tree from rebased filesystem subtrees, with per-mount access and synthetic ancestors. |
| **ReadOnlyFs** | Delegates reads, denies every mutation with `PermissionDenied`, even writes to `/tmp`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `chmod`. For inspection-only sessions. |
| **RealFs** (`realfs` feature) | Direct access to a host directory. Read-only (safe) or read-write (dangerous); path traversal blocked by canonicalisation + root-prefix checks. |

## Mounting host directories

Real host access is **opt-in and read-only by default**. The `realfs` feature
adds builder and CLI entry points:

```rust,no_run
use bashkit::Bash;

# fn main() -> bashkit::Result<()> {
let mut bash = Bash::builder()
    .mount_real_readonly("/host/data")        // visible read-only inside the VFS
    .build();
# let _ = bash;
# Ok(())
# }
```

```bash
bashkit --mount-ro /host/data:/data -c 'ls /data'   # read-only
bashkit --mount-rw /host/out:/out  -c 'echo hi > /out/f'  # writable (dangerous)
```

To freeze a session, including in-memory writes, wrap it with
`readonly_filesystem()`.

## Composing a static namespace

`NamespaceFs` creates an intentionally bounded path tree instead of a fallback
root plus live mounts. Each source may be rebased and independently read-only or
read-write:

```rust
use bashkit::{Bash, FileSystem, InMemoryFs, NamespaceFs};
use std::path::Path;
use std::sync::Arc;

# #[tokio::main]
# async fn main() -> bashkit::Result<()> {
let repository = Arc::new(InMemoryFs::new());
repository.mkdir(Path::new("/repo/src"), true).await?;
repository.write_file(Path::new("/repo/src/lib.rs"), b"source").await?;
let output = Arc::new(InMemoryFs::new());

let namespace = NamespaceFs::builder()
    .mount_readonly_from("/src", repository, "/repo/src")?
    .mount_readwrite("/build", output)?
    .build();
let mut bash = Bash::builder().fs(Arc::new(namespace)).build();
assert_eq!(bash.exec("cat /src/lib.rs").await?.stdout, "source");
# Ok(())
# }
```

Nested targets use longest-prefix precedence. Missing ancestors and mount points
are visible as directories. Files and symlinks can be copied across mounts;
cross-mount rename reports a typed cross-device error because copy-delete is not
atomic.

## Host-backed filesystem (JS)

The wasm bindings accept an `fs` object, so scripts run directly against storage
you own, a Durable Object, an OPFS handle, IndexedDB, instead of the in-memory
VFS. Nothing is copied in or diffed back out: every read and write during the run
is a call into your object.

```js
const bash = new Bash({ cwd: "/workspace", fs: myHost });
const r = await bash.execute("grep -rl TODO . | head -5");
```

Seven methods are required, `read`, `write`, `mkdir`, `remove`, `stat`,
`readDir`, `exists`, and each may return its value directly or as a `Promise`.
`append`, `copy`, `rename`, and `chmod` are optional and synthesized from the
required primitives when omitted. Your host implements raw storage only; POSIX
semantics (parent-directory checks, "is a directory", symlink resolution) are
enforced above it. Throw an `Error` carrying a `code` (`ENOENT`, `EEXIST`,
`EACCES`, …) so bash reports the failure the way a real shell does.

Two contract notes:

- **`execute()` only.** A host call can suspend the interpreter, and
  `executeSync` cannot await, it reports the suspension instead of blocking.
- **`files` is rejected alongside `fs`.** Seeding writes through the VFS
  synchronously, which a promise-returning host can never satisfy.

The host object is the security boundary and is yours to scope (mount root,
allowlist, read-only): paths are normalized before any host call, so traversal
cannot select a path you did not expose, but the sandbox reaches whatever the
object exposes. Reads and writes bypass the in-memory quotas. See
[`@everruns/bashkit-wasm`](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/blob/main/crates/bashkit-wasm/README.md#host-backed-filesystem)
for the full method table and error-code list.

## Special files and symlinks

- **`/dev/null`** is handled at the interpreter level (not the filesystem), so a
  custom backend can't intercept it. **`/dev/urandom`** / **`/dev/random`**
  return bounded random data.
- **Symlinks** are stored but never followed, this closes symlink-escape
  (TM-ESC-002) and symlink-loop DoS (TM-DOS-011).

## Binding parity

Every language binding exposes the same concepts, so the model is identical from
Rust, Python, and Node:

```text
files:  { "/path": "content" }                 # writable in-memory text files
mounts: [{ host_path, vfs_path?, writable? }]  # real FS (read-only by default)
readonly_filesystem: bool                       # deny all VFS mutations after setup
```

The wasm bindings additionally accept `fs`, an embedder-supplied filesystem
that replaces the in-memory VFS entirely. See
[Host-backed filesystem (JS)](#host-backed-filesystem-js) above.
