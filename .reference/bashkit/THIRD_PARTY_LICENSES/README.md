# Third-Party Licenses

This directory contains license texts for projects that have influenced
Bashkit's design or whose test case formats have inspired our testing approach.

## Important Notes

1. **Bashkit is an independent implementation.** No source code has been copied
   from any of these projects. All Rust code in Bashkit is original.

2. **Test cases are original.** While our testing methodology was inspired by
   projects like Oils, the actual test cases are written specifically for
   Bashkit.

3. **Dependencies are via Cargo.** Rust dependencies (like jaq for jq support)
   are included via standard Cargo dependency management, not by copying source.
