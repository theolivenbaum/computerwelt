# Builtin Inventory

[`builtins.json`](builtins.json) is a generated view of implementation state: the
list of builtin commands the interpreter registers, with their supported flags.

Do not edit it by hand. Regenerate and commit it with the behavior change that
caused it:

```console
$ just regen-builtins
```

`builtins-drift.yml` fails CI when the committed file no longer matches what the
code registers. Design for the builtins themselves lives in
[builtins](../foundations/builtins.md); known gaps in [limitations](../operations/limitations.md).
