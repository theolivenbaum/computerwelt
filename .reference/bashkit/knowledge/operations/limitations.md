# Limitations

## Status
Living document (updated as limitations are added/lifted)

## Summary

The negative spec: what Bashkit deliberately does NOT do (and why), plus
known partial implementations. Absences can't be recovered from code, so
they're recorded here; everything positive is generated or tested instead:

- **Builtin inventory**: generated [`builtins.json`](../status/builtins.json)
  (`just regen-builtins`, drift-checked by `builtins-drift.yml`)
- **Test counts / pass rates**: CI (`spec_tests::bash_spec_tests` suite);
  spec cases in `crates/bashkit/tests/spec_cases/`
- **Resource limit defaults**: `crates/bashkit/src/limits.rs`
- **Hook/binding API surface**: rustdoc + binding type stubs

Intentional-limitation IDs (`L-<AREA>-<NNN>`) are stable: code comments
and docs reference them (like TM-* threat IDs). Never renumber; mark
lifted limitations as removed in the PR that lifts them.
`limitations_doc_format` in `crates/bashkit/tests/integration/` lints the
table format and ID uniqueness; evidence cells naming `l_*` tests must
resolve to functions in `limitations_evidence_tests.rs` (also linted).
`stance` marks rows that are positions rather than testable behaviors.

## Intentional Limitations

By design, these conflict with the sandboxed, virtual, stateless
execution model. Evidence is a threat-model ID, a test, or `stance`
(untestable position).

| ID | Limitation | Why | Evidence |
|----|------------|-----|----------|
| L-PROC-001 | `exec` does not replace the process; `exec cmd` runs cmd then stops execution (fd redirects work) | True process replace would break sandbox containment | TM-ESC-005 |
| L-PROC-002 | No job control (`bg`, `fg`, `jobs`) | Requires process state; interactive-only feature | `l_proc_002_no_job_control` |
| L-PROC-003 | No process spawning; external commands run as builtins | Core sandbox model: no fork/exec escape surface | `l_proc_003_no_process_spawning` |
| L-FS-001 | Symlinks stored but never followed in path resolution (`ln -s` works, `read_link()` returns targets, traversal blocked) | Prevents symlink loops and link-based sandbox escapes | TM-DOS-011 |
| L-FS-002 | No file permission enforcement in the VFS | Single-tenant virtual FS; permissions would be theater | `l_fs_002_no_permission_enforcement` |
| L-FS-003 | On Windows, `RealFs::symlink()` validates the target but creates an empty host file rather than a symlink/reparse point; pre-existing host symlinks and junctions remain readable subject to containment checks | Windows requires choosing file-vs-directory link semantics and may require link privileges; the portable VFS symlink contract does not carry that host metadata | TM-ESC-033 |
| L-NET-001 | No raw network sockets; HTTP only via `curl`/`wget`/`http` builtins | Allowlist-mediated egress is the only network surface | `l_net_001_no_raw_sockets` |
| L-NET-002 | No DNS resolution; hosts must appear in the allowlist | Resolution would bypass allowlist intent | `l_net_002_default_deny_no_resolution` |
| L-SIG-001 | `trap` stores INT/TERM handlers but no signal delivery in virtual mode (EXIT, ERR fire) | No host signals exist inside the sandbox | `l_sig_001_signal_traps_not_delivered` |
| L-WASM-001 | **Removed:** JS-host timers now drive `sleep`, builtin `timeout`, execution limits, and tool `timeoutMs` | `gloo-timers` bridges the host event-loop clock without threads or cross-origin isolation | [Browser Package](../runtimes/browser-package.md) |
| L-WASM-002 | Browser build: `executeSync()` cannot run async custom builtins (fails with a clear message); use `execute()` | Single-threaded event loop can't settle a JS `Promise` without yielding | `crates/bashkit-wasm/__test__/bashkit-wasm.test.mjs` |
| L-WASM-003 | Browser build: background jobs (`cmd &`) run synchronously and `awk` file redirects drive the VFS inline; no work runs on a separate thread | `wasm32-unknown-unknown` is single-threaded, `std::thread::spawn`/`tokio::spawn` are unavailable; safe because the in-memory VFS never suspends | `crates/bashkit-wasm/__test__/bashkit-wasm.test.mjs` |
| L-CAPI-001 | C ABI v1 excludes callbacks, custom builtins, streaming, async cancellation, host mounts, transport hooks, snapshots, scripted tools, and external filesystem providers | These require explicit reentrancy, callback lifetime, and dynamic-library unload contracts | [C API](../runtimes/c-api.md), stance |
| L-STREAM-001 | Shell words, variables, command substitution, script source, text-oriented builtins, and JSON tool responses cannot represent arbitrary bytes. Command substitution removes NUL; other text boundaries decode invalid UTF-8 with replacement. Use `StreamData`, binding byte fields, redirects, or byte-oriented builtins for exact data | Bash variables and the parser are text domains; JSON strings are Unicode | `byte_stream_tests`, [Architecture](../foundations/architecture.md) |

### Design Rationale

**Stateless execution model**: scripts run in isolated, stateless
contexts; each command completes before the next begins. Prevents
resource leaks from orphaned work, simplifies limit enforcement, keeps
agent runs deterministic. (`&` background execution + `wait` are
supported within an exec call.)

**bash/sh as virtual re-invocation**: `bash script.sh` / `bash -c` /
`bash -n` re-enter the Bashkit interpreter, same virtual environment,
shared state and limits, never an external process. `bash --version`
reports Bashkit. Security analysis: TM-ESC-015 in
[threat-model.md](../security/threat-model.md).

## POSIX Compliance Stance

Target: IEEE 1003.1-2024 Shell Command Language.

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Reserved words, special parameters | Full | All 16 / all 8 |
| Special built-in utilities | Substantial | 14/15; `exec` partial (L-PROC-001); `times` returns zeros; `trap` per L-SIG-001 |
| Quoting, redirections, compound commands, functions | Full | |
| Word expansions | Substantial | Most expansions supported |
| Pipelines and lists | Full | `\|`, `&&`, `\|\|`, `;`, `&`+`wait`, `!` |

## Shell Features

### Not Yet Implemented

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| History expansion | Out of scope | Interactive only |
| `<>` read-write redirect | Low | Parser rejects the operator; `ScriptAnalysis` therefore has no read-write mode (`readwrite_redirect_opens_file`, skipped) |

### Partially Implemented

| Feature | What Works | What's Missing |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| Prefix env assignments | `VAR=val cmd` temporarily sets env for cmd | Array prefix assignments not in env |
| `local` | Declaration | Proper scoping in nested functions |
| `return` | Basic usage | Return value propagation |
| `time` | Reserved-word pipelines; `-p`, `--`, GNU `-f/-o/-a/-v`; elapsed time, exit status, and Bashkit counters | Host user/system CPU, RSS, and other process metrics are reported as `unavailable`, never fabricated |
| `timeout` | Basic usage | `-k` kill timeout |
| `bash`/`sh` | `-c`, `-n`, `-e`, `-x`, `-u`, `-f`, `-o option`, script files, stdin, `--version`, `--help` | Login shell |

## Builtins

Inventory is generated, see [status/builtins.json](../status/builtins.json)
and the [builtins spec](../foundations/builtins.md). No wholly unimplemented
builtins are currently tracked; partial boundaries follow.

| ID | Tool | Limitation | Evidence |
|----|------|------------|----------|
| L-DATE-001 | date | `TZ` accepts bundled IANA identifiers/aliases only. POSIX rule strings and `:zoneinfo` paths are unsupported and intentionally resolve to UTC because the sandbox has no trusted host zoneinfo filesystem. GNU nanosecond formatting supports the useful `%N`/`%3N`/`%6N`/`%9N` forms, not other widths | `date_timezone_tests` |

## Text Processing

What each tool does is covered by its spec tests (all unskipped tests
pass in CI); only divergences and boundaries are recorded here.

| ID | Tool | Limitation | Evidence |
|----|------|------------|----------|
| L-AWK-001 | awk | Some complex regex patterns unsupported (engine shared with sed/grep, size-limited) | stance |
| L-JQ-001 | jq | Alternative `//`: jaq errors on `.foo` applied to null instead of returning null (upstream jaq divergence) | 1 skipped spec test |
| L-JQ-002 | jq | Regex natives compile the pattern per filter invocation; mapping `test`/`match`/`split` over many inputs can repeat compilation because jaq's native callback has no per-run cache state | `regex_compat.rs::re_native` |
| L-YQ-001 | yq | Expressions are Bashkit jq expressions; mikefarah/yq-only node, comment, style, anchor, tag, filename, and eval-all operators are not implemented | stance |
| L-YQ-002 | yq | YAML conversion follows YAML 1.1, deterministically sorts mapping keys at the JSON-value boundary, drops comments/style/anchors, and rejects aliases, custom tags, non-string mapping keys, and non-finite numbers rather than expanding graphs or silently corrupting data | `yaml_aliases_are_rejected_before_expansion`, `yaml_tags_and_non_string_keys_fail_closed`, `yaml_duplicate_keys_and_lossy_numbers_fail_closed`, `inplace_update_is_atomic_and_suppresses_stdout` |
| L-YQ-003 | yq | Input/output conversion supports YAML and JSON only; mikefarah/yq's XML, CSV, TOML, properties, HCL, Lua, and INI formats are not exposed through yq | stance |
| L-GREP-001 | grep | `--color`/`--colour`, `--line-buffered` accepted as no-ops | `l_grep_001_noop_flags` |
| L-CURL-001 | curl | Spec-test coverage for methods/headers/auth/redirects not ported (needs `http_client` + allowlist in harness); payload behavior has integration and real-curl differential coverage | stance |
| L-CURL-002 | curl/wget | Unknown options are ignored for compatibility, not rejected (real curl/wget error); deliberate leniency | `curl.rs` |
| L-STR-001 | strings | Accepts dash-prefixed filenames (e.g. `-data.bin`), so only a lone unknown short option (`-Q`) is rejected as invalid; GNU rejects `-data.bin` too | `strings.rs` |

Safety boundaries (enforced, not bugs): printf width/precision caps,
output buffer caps, getline file-cache cap, shared regex size limit, runtime regex
cache cap (64 entries and 1 MB retained pattern text per evaluator),
curl/wget timeouts clamped to [1, 600] s, multipart field-name
sanitization, redirect handling hardened against credential leaks, and curl's
aggregate data/multipart request body capped at 10 MB. Repeated mixed curl
`-d`/`--data`, `--data-raw`, `--data-binary`, and `--data-urlencode` parts retain
command-line order; `-G`/`--get` moves their joined payload to the query string.
The jq input boundary alone accepts literal U+0000..U+001F controls inside JSON
strings; controls outside strings and malformed quoting remain invalid. The
`json` builtin, serde defaults, tool JSON contracts, `--argjson`, and
`--jsonargs` stay strict. See [jq Input Compatibility](../foundations/jq.md).
Archive compression is intentionally in-process and limited to gzip and bzip2;
GNU tar selectors for xz, lzip, lzma, compress, and zstd remain unsupported.

## CLI

Divergences in the `bashkit` binary's one-shot (`-c` / script) mode.
Positional parameters, stdin forwarding, and streaming output all work;
what remains is how stdin is obtained.

| ID | Limitation | Why | Evidence |
|----|------------|-----|----------|
| L-CLI-002 | Host stdin is read to EOF *before* execution, not lazily when a command asks for it, and only when stdin is not a terminal. `cmd \| bashkit -c 'echo hi'` waits for the writer to finish even though the script never reads; `--no-stdin` opts out | The interpreter takes its stdin as a value up front (`ExecOptions::stdin`); lazy reads would need a reader-backed fd 0 in the sandbox. Capped at 10 MiB so an unbounded stream can't exhaust memory | `crates/bashkit-cli/tests/cli_oneshot.rs` |

## Parser

- Single-quoted strings are completely literal (correct behavior)
- Some complex nested structures may hit the parser timeout
- Very long pipelines may cause stack issues
- Bounded by configurable limits: timeout, fuel, input size, AST depth

## Lifting a Limitation / Adding One

1. Add a spec test demonstrating it, marked `### skip: reason`
   (or an expected-fail differential test)
2. Add a row here, with an `L-*` ID if it's an intentional decision
3. When lifting: un-skip the test, delete the row, update referencing
   code comments in the same PR
