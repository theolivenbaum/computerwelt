# Pre-Release Maintenance

## Status
Implemented

## Abstract

Requirements for pre-release maintenance. Ensures no regressions, stale docs,
dependency rot, or security gaps ship in a release.

## When to Run

- Before every minor or major release
- Quarterly for patch-only periods
- After large feature merges

## Requirements

### Dependencies

- All direct dependencies at latest versions, including major/breaking upgrades
- Upgrade procedure for each outdated dependency:
  1. Bump version constraint in `Cargo.toml` (workspace or crate-level)
  2. Run `cargo build`, fix any compilation errors from API changes
  3. Run `cargo test`, fix any test failures
  4. If upgrade requires non-trivial refactoring (>50 lines changed), defer to a
     tracked GitHub issue instead of blocking the maintenance pass
- `cargo update` run after all version bumps to lock latest patch versions
- No known CVEs in dependency tree
- License and advisory checks pass (`deny.toml`)
- Supply chain audit passes
- Dependency tree analysis (`cargo tree --duplicates`, usage grep):
  - No unused/dead dependencies in workspace or crate Cargo.toml files
  - Single-builtin deps behind feature flags (not always-on)
  - No full crates where a sub-crate suffices (e.g. `futures-util` vs `futures`)
  - Duplicate transitive versions reviewed, fix or document why unfixable

#### Automated coverage

`.github/dependabot.yml` drives weekly *version* updates. It is separate from
Dependabot **alerts** and **security updates**, which run off the repository
dependency graph and need no config — an ecosystem missing from
`dependabot.yml` still gets alerts, it just never gets routine freshness bumps,
so it drifts until the eventual security fix is a multi-major jump.

Covered, one grouped PR per entry per week:

| Ecosystem | Directory |
|---|---|
| cargo | `/` (workspace) |
| cargo | `/crates/bashkit/fuzz` (separate workspace + lockfile) |
| npm | `/site` |
| npm | `/crates/bashkit-js` |
| npm | `/examples`, `/examples/browser`, `/examples/bashkit-pi` |
| github-actions | `/` |

Deliberately not covered, and why:

- `@everruns/*` is ignored in every npm entry. Those are this repo's own
  published packages, pinned to the workspace version by the release process
  ([Release Process](release-process.md)); dependabot moving them independently
  races that process.
- `crates/bashkit-wasm` has a `package.json` with no dependencies and no
  lockfile, so there is nothing to update.
- `.deepsec/` is updated by hand during the security pass below
  (`pnpm update deepsec@latest`), because the scan is run against whatever
  version the pass pulls, not on dependabot's schedule.
- Python: `crates/bashkit-python/pyproject.toml` declares only optional extras
  with open lower bounds (`>=`) and ships no lockfile, so a pip entry would
  have nothing to pin.

### Security

- Threat model ([Threat Model](../security/threat-model.md)) covers all current features
- Public threat model doc (`crates/bashkit/docs/threat-model.md`) in sync with spec
- Every new builtin/feature has a corresponding TM-XXX entry
- DeepSec is updated to the latest published version before scanning:
  - Run `cd .deepsec && pnpm update deepsec@latest`
  - Run `pnpm deepsec scan --project-id bashkit`
  - Run `pnpm deepsec process --project-id bashkit --agent codex`
  - Review `pnpm deepsec report --project-id bashkit` and create GitHub issues
    for any deferred findings
- Security tests exist for every MITIGATED threat
- Failpoint tests pass
- Unsafe usage reviewed (`cargo geiger`)
- No OWASP-style issues (injection, path traversal, etc.)

### Tests

- All tests pass
- No test gaps for recently added features
- `builtins-drift` workflow green (generated [`builtins.json`](../status/builtins.json) in sync)
- Bash compatibility, no new regressions against real bash
- Coverage reviewed, no major uncovered paths

### Documentation

- Rust crate docs (`lib.rs`) match reality: command count, categories, guide list, features, examples
- Guide docs (`crates/bashkit/docs/`) up to date: compatibility, threat-model, custom_builtins, logging, python
- Rustdoc builds clean (no warnings)
- Python docs (`crates/bashkit-python/README.md`) match current bindings and exports
- Python docstrings match behavior
- `README.md` feature list matches implemented builtins
- Public docs (`docs/`) match current code: CLI flags, security boundaries, feature descriptions, test counts, and examples all reflect reality
- Relative markdown links resolve as source: `just check-doc-links` green. The
  site rewrites link targets by *basename* (`DOC_LINKS` in
  `site/astro.config.mjs`), so a cross-tree link written as a bare `jq.md`
  renders correctly on bashkit.sh while 404-ing for anyone reading the markdown
  on GitHub, `site/scripts/verify-doc-*.mjs` check the built routes and cannot
  see it. Write cross-tree links source-relative
  (`../crates/bashkit/docs/jq.md`); the site rewriter accepts that form too.
  Do **not** add YAML frontmatter to `docs/` or `crates/bashkit/docs/` to carry
  titles or descriptions: page metadata lives in `site/src/pages/docs/_meta.ts`,
  and frontmatter in `crates/bashkit/docs/` would leak into rustdoc via
  `include_str!`
- Agent surfaces (`/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, Markdown routes) regenerate and pass `verify-llms` (auto-enforced in CI); refresh the agent-skills tarball/`index.json` digest if `skills/bashkit/` changed (see [Documentation Architecture](documentation.md) § Agent-facing site surfaces)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` instructions accurate
- `CHANGELOG.md` has entries for all changes since last release

### Examples

- All Rust examples compile and run
- Feature-gated examples work (python, git)
- Python agent examples run end-to-end
- Code examples in docs/rustdoc still accurate
- `examples/browser` uses exact dependency versions and a committed lockfile:
  run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm start`, load
  the page, and confirm it runs a plain command, a pipe through `jq`, **and a
  subshell** (`bash /home/user/demo.sh`). The subshell path exercises the wasm
  child-shell parse that a top-level command does not, the smoke suite in
  `crates/bashkit-wasm/__test__/` covers the same ground headlessly. If the
  published package lags a fix the example depends on, hold the example until
  the next `bashkit-wasm` release, then review and update both the dependency
  pin and lockfile.

### Specs

- Each spec status reflects reality
- `limitations.md` rows still true (lifted limitations removed)
- No orphaned TODOs in specs that are now resolved
- New features have spec entries

### Coreutils Argument-Surface and Module-Vendor Drift

See [Coreutils Argument Port](../runtimes/coreutils-args-port.md).

- Review any open `chore: sync uutils/coreutils argument surfaces and
  vendored modules` PR produced by the `coreutils-args-drift` workflow
  (weekly cron). The PR covers **both** ported argument surfaces (args
  mode) and vendored uucore modules (module mode):
  - **Args mode review**: confirm new flags are wired into the
    consuming builtin or explicitly rejected (matching the existing
    `tac -b/-r/-s` "not yet implemented" pattern, no silent no-ops).
    Confirm removed/renamed flags don't break downstream scripts;
    migrate or document.
  - **Module mode review**: for every entry in
    `crates/bashkit-coreutils-port/vendored.toml`, scan the diff for
    body changes in the vendored sources, this is verbatim copy, so
    upstream behaviour changes land directly. Validate that
    `vendored.toml` substitutions still cover every internal `use`
    (the port aborts loudly if not, but check that the rationale of
    any `error` actions still reflects intent).
  - Squash-merge as a human (PR's intermediate commits are bot-authored).
  - Confirm the `coreutils_differential_tests` step in the auto-PR is
    green, body drift (semantic divergence vs GNU/uutils) surfaces here
    even when args parity holds.
- Run `just regen-coreutils-args` locally if no drift PR exists; commit any
  diff yourself rather than letting it accumulate. Module-mode regen is
  driven by the same workflow; trigger `workflow_dispatch` if you need
  to refresh vendored modules out-of-band.
- Bump the pinned uutils revision recorded in the generated file headers
  if it has fallen >3 months behind upstream `main`.

### Code Quality

- Formatted (`cargo fmt`)
- No clippy warnings
- No stale TODO/WTF comments that are now resolved
- No dead code or unused dependencies

### Code Simplification

- Duplicated patterns consolidated into shared helpers where it reduces total code
- Unnecessary abstractions, indirection, or over-engineering removed
- Complex nested logic simplified (deep nesting, long match arms)
- Dead code removed (unused functions, unreachable branches, commented-out code)
- Names are clear and descriptive (functions, variables, types)
- No premature generalizations, code serves current needs, not hypothetical future ones

### Binding Parity

- Python and Node bindings expose the same public API surface
- Feature gaps tracked and resolved before release
- Parity checklist:
  - Core classes: `Bash`, `BashTool`, `ExecResult`, `ScriptedTool`, `BashError`
  - Execution methods: `execute`, `execute_sync`, `executeOrThrow`/`execute_or_throw`
  - Configuration: `username`, `hostname`, `max_commands`, `max_loop_iterations`, `python`, `external_functions`/`external_handler`
  - Mount API: `files` dict, `mounts` list (read-only default), runtime `mount`/`unmount` (see [Virtual Filesystem](../foundations/vfs.md) § Binding API Parity)
  - Tool metadata: `name`, `description`, `help`, `system_prompt`, `input_schema`, `output_schema`, `version`
  - Module functions: `getVersion`/`get_version`
  - Framework integrations: LangChain available in both bindings
  - ExecResult fields: `stdout`, `stderr`, `exit_code`, `error`, `success`, truncation flags, `final_env`
- New features added to one binding must have a tracking issue for the other

### Agent Configuration

- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` instructions accurate
- Spec table in `AGENTS.md` lists all current specs
- Build/test commands work
- Pre-PR checklist covers current tooling

### CI Health

- **CI on main is green**: the latest CI run on `main` must pass. Any failure
  (audit, test, lint, examples) is a blocker that must be fixed before
  proceeding with the rest of the maintenance pass.
- Nightly and fuzz workflows green for past week
- Fuzz targets compile
- Git-sourced dependencies still resolve

#### Escalation Policy

Failures persisting **>2 consecutive days** on any workflow (CI, nightly, fuzz)
are blocking:
1. Open GitHub issue with label `ci:nightly`
2. Link failing run(s)
3. Assign to most recent contributor in failing area
4. If upstream dep change: pin to known-good rev, open follow-up issue

**This section is a hard gate.** The maintenance pass MUST NOT be marked
complete or merged while any of the above checks are red. If the agent cannot
fix a failure, it must open a GitHub issue and report the pass as blocked.

## Deferred Items

When a maintenance pass identifies issues too large to fix inline (e.g.
multi-file refactors, cross-cutting changes), the pass must:

1. Create a GitHub issue for each deferred item with clear scope and reproduction steps
2. Record the issue numbers in the summary below so they are tracked

Deferred items are **not** failures, they are expected for large-scope
improvements. The requirement is that they are **tracked**, not silently skipped.

### Deferred items

Standing transitive limitation:

- **RustCrypto 0.10/0.11 split** (was tracked as #1634, now closed). Our
  directly-declared hashes (`md-5`/`sha1`/`sha2`) are on the 0.11 line, but the
  dependency tree still pulls in the 0.10 line transitively, `aes-gcm 0.10.3`
  (and its `digest 0.10` / `sha2 0.10` / `aead 0.5` / `cipher 0.4` chain) via
  `turso_core`, plus the `russh` / `argon2` crypto stack. Resolution remains
  blocked on those upstreams releasing on the 0.11 line; no in-tree action
  available.

Previously tracked items resolved: #880 (ArgParser migration), #881 (errexit
propagation helper).

## Automation

Sections dependencies, tests, examples, code quality, and nightly CI are fully
automatable. Security, documentation, specs, simplification, and agent config
require human or agent review.

CI health check enforced by `just check-nightly` (nightly + fuzz) and manual
inspection of CI on `main` (audit, test, lint). Called by `just release-check`.

## Invocation

Use `/maintain` skill to execute this checklist interactively.
