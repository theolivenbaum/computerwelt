# Parser Design

## Status
Implemented

## Decision

Recursive descent parser with a context-aware lexer.

```
Input → Lexer → Tokens → Parser → AST
```

Token types, AST structures, and parser grammar live in
`crates/bashkit/src/parser/`. They evolve as features are added.

### Parser Rules (Simplified)

```
script        → command_list EOF
command_list  → pipeline (('&&' | '||' | ';' | '&') pipeline)*
pipeline      → command ('|' command)*
command       → simple_command | compound_command | function_def
time_command  → 'time' time_option* pipeline
simple_command → (assignment)* word (word | redirect)*
redirect      → ('>' | '>>' | '<' | '<<' | '<<<') word
               | NUMBER ('>' | '<') word
```

`time` is a reserved-word compound command, not a normal builtin. Its body is
therefore a pipeline AST and can contain groups, functions, nested `time`, and
redirections without converting shell syntax back into strings. Bashkit accepts
Bash/POSIX `-p` plus `--` and the practical GNU report flags `-f/--format`,
`-o/--output`, `-a/--append`, and `-v/--verbose` on this grammar node.

### Context-Aware Lexing

Handles bash's context-sensitivity:
- `$var` in double quotes: expand; in single quotes: literal
- Word splitting after expansion
- Glob patterns (*, ?, [])
- Brace expansion: `{a,b,c}` and `{1..5}` vs brace groups `{ cmd; }`
- Tilde expansion: `~` at start of word expands to `$HOME`

### Arithmetic Expressions

`$((expr))` supports: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, comparisons, logical `&&`/`||`
(short-circuit), bitwise operators, ternary `?:`, variable references.

### Error Recovery

Errors carry line/column, expected vs. found token, and parse context.

A nested parse must never silently vanish. `parse_word` is infallible (the
interpreter also calls it for lazy parameter expansion), so a `$(...)` body that
fails to parse still pushes its `CommandSubstitution` part, with empty commands
, and stashes the inner error in `Parser::deferred_error`, which `parse_script`
turns into a hard parse error. Both halves matter: the retained part keeps the
word non-literal so surrounding literals cannot splice (`a$(|)b` must not become
the command `ab`, which `analysis` would report to a host permission gate, see
TM-ESC-032), and the deferred error rejects the script the way bash does.
Process substitution keeps its part for the same reason, and hard-errors on
budget failures (TM-DOS-021).

## Alternatives Considered

- PEG (pest, pom): rejected, bash grammar is context-sensitive, here-docs awkward, manual parser gives better errors.
- Tree-sitter: rejected, incremental parsing overkill, large dep, harder to customize.
