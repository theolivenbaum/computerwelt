"""Teardown determinism tests (TM-PY-030).

While the interpreter is alive, dropping a tool must deterministically
release everything it owns BEFORE the drop returns: the private-loop worker
thread is joined, its asyncio loop is closed (fds freed), and the tokio
blocking pool is joined. Abandoned timed-out callbacks are cancelled
cooperatively rather than awaited to completion. At interpreter exit the
machinery goes hands-off instead (covered by the subprocess tests).
