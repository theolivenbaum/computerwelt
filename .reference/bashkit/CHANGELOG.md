# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-06

### Highlights

- **Browser WASM can run directly against host-owned storage.** The browser
  bindings now accept asynchronous filesystem adapters for Durable Objects,
  IndexedDB, OPFS, and similar stores, and add analysis, cancellation,
  streaming, snapshots, and binary VFS APIs to reach native-binding parity
  ([#2275](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2275),
  [#2255](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2255)).
- **Execution boundaries are typed, shared, and revocable.** New execution
  profiles configure coherent limits across runtimes, one request budget
  follows work across subsystem boundaries, and host capabilities stop working
  when their execution ends. Hosts can also suspend a live shell for a
  process-local callback and resume it with byte-exact input and output
  ([#2254](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2254),
  [#2253](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2253),
  [#2264](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2264),
  [#2256](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2256)).
- **Shell streams preserve arbitrary bytes end to end.** Pipelines, redirects,
  command results, callbacks, custom builtins, and Rust, C, Python, Node, and
  browser bindings retain NUL, invalid UTF-8, and high bytes without lossy text
  conversion ([#2252](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2252)).
- **`yq` replaces the narrow `yaml` helper.** The jq-backed builtin handles
  YAML and JSON files, streams, selection, mapping, assignment, format
  conversion, and atomic in-place updates under shared resource limits
  ([#2266](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2266),
  [#2269](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2269)).
- **More common shell workflows run inside the sandbox.** GNU-compatible
  bzip2 archives and standalone compression commands interoperate with system
  tools, while `time` reports truthful elapsed time, status, and Bashkit-owned
  work counters without fabricating host CPU or memory data
  ([#2265](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2265),
  [#2263](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2263)).

### Breaking Changes

- **Rust stream fields are now byte-native.** Public fields that previously
  used `String` now use `StreamData`; callers constructing results or options
  should pass bytes through `StreamData` and convert to text explicitly at
  their application boundary. Language bindings retain their text views and
  add raw-byte stdout/stderr fields.
- **Execution-scoped host access expires with the request.** Extension and
  callback consumers must use `ExecutionCapability::try_with` or `run`, and
  handle revocation-aware `ToolArgs` context getters. Hosts that deliberately
  need session-lived raw VFS access must register through
  `BuiltinRegistry::insert_trusted`.
- **The nonstandard `yaml` builtin is removed.** Enable the existing `jq`
  feature and invoke `yq` with jq-style filters. YAML is converted through a
  JSON value model, so comments, styles, anchors, and source key order are not
  preserved; unsupported tags and non-string keys fail closed.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.15.0...v0.16.0

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-03

### Highlights

- **Snapshots become a content-addressed history rather than a single blob.**
  `commit`/`checkout` store a session as deduplicated objects, so a fork or an
  incremental save costs only what changed. Adds `SnapshotGraph` for ancestry,
  diffs, reachability, and lazy fetch planning, plus a `CheckoutPolicy`
  capability gate that refuses to restore a session into an environment missing
  builtins or features it needs. Available from Rust, Python, and JavaScript
  ([#2223](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2223)).
- **Bashkit now ships a native C API.** Five platform archives expose a
  versioned `libbashkit` ABI with opaque handles, binary-safe VFS access,
  explicit ownership, runnable C examples, and SHA-256 checksums
  ([#2238](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2238)).
- **One-shot CLI execution now behaves like a real shell invocation.** Script
  arguments populate `$0` and positional parameters, piped stdin reaches the
  script, and stdout/stderr stream before completion or resource-limit failure
  ([#2234](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2234)).
- **Path expansion and malformed substitutions are safer and more compatible.**
  Globs expand every path component, while invalid `$(...)` syntax now fails
  closed instead of inventing a command name for permission analysis
  ([#2232](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2232),
  [#2231](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2231)).
- **Arithmetic side effects no longer panic at 64-bit integer boundaries.**
  Compound assignment and prefix/postfix increment and decrement now wrap with
  Bash-compatible integer semantics in both evaluator paths.
- **Static analysis rejects malformed literal boundaries.** Source bytes
  reserved as internal lexer/expansion sentinels and unterminated quote segments
  now fail analysis instead of being normalized into a command name that was
  not present in the script. Analysis also rejects malformed heredoc
  reinjection that inserts command-name characters. Script execution retains
  its existing control-byte behavior.

### Breaking Changes

- **`Bash::snapshot()` now writes the v2 content-addressed container.** Existing
  snapshots still restore, but snapshots written by 0.15.0 require Bashkit
  0.14.5 or newer. Upgrade rollback targets to 0.14.5 before producing v2
  snapshots; re-snapshot before rolling back further. Future readers get the
  typed `SnapshotTooNew { required, supported }` error when an upgrade is
  required.
- **Snapshot restore now checks runtime capabilities.** `restore_snapshot`
  defaults to `CheckoutPolicy::Superset`; a runtime missing a builtin, feature,
  or filesystem capability recorded by the snapshot rejects it. Use
  `restore_snapshot_with_policy(..., CheckoutPolicy::Force)` only when the host
  deliberately accepts that mismatch. Removing or renaming a builtin can make
  older snapshots fail this check.
- **Two typed snapshot errors were added to the exhaustive `bashkit::Error`
  enum.** Rust callers that exhaustively match `Error` must handle
  `SnapshotTooNew` and `SnapshotCapabilityMismatch`.

### What's Changed

* feat(c-api): add native C ABI ([#2238](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2238)) by @chaliy
* fix(deps): resolve Dependabot vulnerabilities ([#2235](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2235)) by @chaliy
* feat(cli): script arguments, stdin forwarding, and streaming output for one-shot mode ([#2234](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2234)) by @chaliy
* fix(glob): expand every path component, not just the trailing one ([#2232](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2232)) by @chaliy
* fix(parser): reject a malformed $(...) instead of splicing its literals ([#2231](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2231)) by @chaliy
* feat(snapshot): write v2 and expose the history API ([#2223](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2223)) by @chaliy

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.14.5...v0.15.0

## [0.14.5] - 2026-08-01

### Highlights

- **Snapshots can now be read in a format bashkit does not yet write.** The
  next release stores sessions as a content-addressed object graph, which is a
  new on-disk format. This release teaches the reader that format and changes
  nothing else, so a deployment can take it first and still be able to read
  what the next release writes
  ([#2226](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2226)).
- **Scripts can be inspected before they run.** `analyze()` — in Rust, Node,
  and Python — returns a static report of the commands, arguments, redirect
  targets, and function definitions a script refers to, for host permission
  prompts and audit logging. It is advisory by design: dynamic dispatch,
  `eval`/`source`, nested shells, and truncated walks surface as unknown via
  `is_opaque`, with the `before_tool` hook remaining the enforcement backstop
  ([#2222](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2222)).

### Upgrading

- Both additions are backward compatible. `snapshot()` still writes the same
  bytes, every existing snapshot restores exactly as before, and `analyze()` is
  purely additive.
- **Take this release before the one that writes the new format.** Versions
  older than this one fail on the new format with `expected value at line 1
  column 1` — a JSON parse error naming neither the version nor the format —
  so they are not usable rollback targets. This release is.
- From the new format onward this cannot recur: the container header records a
  `min_reader` version, so a reader too old for a snapshot says so and points at
  the upgrade instead of reporting corruption.

### What's Changed

* feat(snapshot): read the v2 container without writing it ([#2226](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2226)) by @chaliy

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.14.4...v0.14.5

## [0.14.4] - 2026-07-27

### Highlights

- **Python wheels now use CPython's stable ABI.** One `cp39-abi3` wheel per
  platform supports every Python version from 3.9 onward, reducing native
  release artifacts from 42 wheels (~500 MiB) to 7 (~85 MiB). This prevents
  the partial PyPI publications that left 0.14.2 unavailable on Python
  3.12–3.14 ([#2190](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2190)).
- **Browser files can persist across sessions.** The browser example stores
  its virtual filesystem in browser storage, tolerates environments where
  storage access is blocked, and rejects timeout guarantees that the
  single-threaded WebAssembly runtime cannot enforce
  ([#2192](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2192),
  [#2211](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2211),
  [#2213](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2213)).
- **Async filesystem operations no longer block current-thread runtimes.**
  RealFs path resolution and metadata operations now use asynchronous host
  filesystem I/O. Async embedders should use `RealFs::open`; the blocking
  `RealFs::new` constructor is deprecated
  ([#2205](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2205)).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.14.3...v0.14.4

## [0.14.3] - 2026-07-18

### Highlights

- **Unknown options are now rejected like real Bash + coreutils.** Invoking the
  shell with an unrecognized option (`bash --verison`) and passing an unknown
  option to 26 builtins (`wc -Q`, `sort -Z`, …) previously ignored the option
  silently and continued as if it were absent. Both now print the real
  Bash/GNU-coreutils diagnostic and exit non-zero (coreutils exit codes
  preserved), so a mistyped flag in an agent-generated script surfaces instead
  of hiding ([#2182](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2182),
  [#2184](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2184)).
- **Browser/WebAssembly npm package renamed** `@everruns/bashkit-web` →
  **`@everruns/bashkit-wasm`**, matching the Rust crate and reflecting that the
  build runs in any JavaScript runtime (browsers, edge/serverless workers,
  Node/Deno/Bun), not just browsers
  ([#2183](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2183)).

### What's Changed

* fix(builtins): reject unknown options like real coreutils ([#2184](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2184)) by @chaliy
* chore(wasm): rename npm package to @everruns/bashkit-wasm ([#2183](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2183)) by @chaliy
* fix(interpreter): reject unknown bash/sh invocation options like real Bash ([#2182](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2182)) by @chaliy
* docs: polish the browser example showcase ([#2181](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2181)) by @chaliy
* chore(examples): rebuild browser example on @everruns/bashkit-web ([#2180](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2180)) by @chaliy

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.14.2...v0.14.3

## [0.14.2] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- **Browser wasm crashes on core shell features** — subshells (`bash -c`,
  `sh -c`, `bash script.sh`, pipe-into-`bash`), `sleep`, `timeout`,
  background jobs (`cmd &` / `wait`), and `awk` file redirects
  (`print > "f"` / `getline < "f"`) hard-panicked on the single-threaded
  `@everruns/bashkit-web` build, poisoning the whole module. These paths now
  run inline on wasm instead of assuming a multi-threaded tokio runtime with a
  timer driver; native behavior is unchanged
  ([#2178](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2178)).

### What's Changed

* fix(wasm): make bashkit run on single-threaded browser wasm ([#2178](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2178)) by @chaliy

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.14.1...v0.14.2

## [0.14.1] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- **Browser package publishing** — enable the stable WebAssembly bulk-memory
  and nontrapping float-to-int features during Binaryen optimization, and run
  that optimized path in pull-request CI. This fixes publication of the new
  `@everruns/bashkit-web` package after the v0.14.0 release build failed.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.14.0...v0.14.1

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-17

### Highlights

- **Browser-native `@everruns/bashkit-web` package** — a slim,
  single-threaded WebAssembly build runs Bashkit directly in browsers without
  `SharedArrayBuffer` or COOP/COEP headers, with async custom builtins and live
  VFS access ([#2175](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2175)).
- **Generic filesystem namespaces** — mount independent filesystems under
  virtual path prefixes, with longest-prefix routing, rebasing, and sandboxed
  namespace examples ([#2174](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2174)).
- **VFS and glob hardening** — directory limits now apply to `add_dir`, and
  glob backtracking correctly restores bracket-match cache state
  ([#2168](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2168),
  [#2167](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2167)).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.13.0...v0.14.0

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-07

### Highlights

- **Pluggable `HttpTransport` for curl/wget** — embedding hosts can direct all
  sandbox HTTP through their own boundary (egress gateway, proxy, audit layer)
  by injecting a transport via `BashBuilder::http_transport`. bashkit keeps
  enforcing policy (allowlist, SSRF precheck, hooks, credential injection,
  bot-auth signing, response caps) before every dispatch; the transport
  receives the merged signed headers, timeouts, the SSRF precheck's pinned
  addresses, and the response size cap, and returns typed errors
  (`Denied`/`Timeout`/`TooLarge`/`Transport`) that map onto curl exit codes
  (7/28/63/1). Mirrors fetchkit's transport injection so one host egress
  implementation can back both libraries. See `knowledge/security/http-transport.md`
  ([#2147](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2147)).
- **`xargs -P` parallel execution** — `-P/--max-procs` runs command batches
  concurrently, with `--process-slot-var` exposing the slot index to each child
  ([#2126](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2126)).
- **`ls -d/--directory`** — list directories themselves instead of their
  contents ([#2134](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2134)).
- **`bashkit-eval` reimplemented on the mira framework** — the LLM eval harness
  now runs on mira ([#2129](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2129)).
- **Linear-time glob `*` matching (TM-DOS-031)** — replaces the pathological
  backtracking that allowed exponential blowup on adversarial patterns
  ([#2142](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2142)).

### Breaking Changes

- **`HttpHandler` removed.** `BashBuilder::http_handler` and
  `HttpClient::set_handler` are replaced by `BashBuilder::http_transport` /
  `HttpClient::set_transport` (no compatibility shim, per repo policy).
  Migration: implement `HttpTransport` — wrap the old
  `(method, url, body, headers)` logic in `execute(HttpTransportRequest)`
  and return `HttpTransportError` variants instead of `String`.
  - Before: `.http_handler(Box::new(MyHandler))`
  - After: `.http_transport(Arc::new(MyTransport))`

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.12.0...v0.13.0

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-23

### Highlights

- **`ExecOptions` request struct + `exec_with_options` entry point** — a single,
  extensible request object for configuring a run, replacing ad-hoc parameter
  threading at the library boundary
  ([#2093](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2093)).
- **`BashToolBuilder::configure` for full `BashBuilder` access** — LLM-tool
  callers can now reach the complete builder surface when wiring up a tool
  ([#2104](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2104)).
- **Self-hosted Python + TypeScript API references at `/api`** — the binding API
  docs are now built and hosted from the repo, with new public guides and a
  reorganized docs navigation
  ([#2109](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2109),
  [#2111](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2111)).
- **`agents`-friendly site surfaces** — `llms.txt` agent entry points, linked
  skill sources, and cross-linked Markdown surfaces make the site easier for
  agents to consume ([#2099](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2099),
  [#2106](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2106)).
- **Interpreter correctness & security sweep** — typed-state refactors of the
  directory stack, `$!`, and `getopts` cursors, plus a batch of parser/expansion
  fixes and several dependency security-advisory patches.

### Breaking Changes

- **`PythonLimits` / `TypeScriptLimits` fields moved under a shared `common: RuntimeLimits`.**
  The two embedded-VM limit types now share a `RuntimeLimits` core (duration,
  memory, allocations, call depth)
  ([#2095](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2095)). The fluent builder
  API is unchanged, but code that read the `pub max_*` fields directly must now
  go through `.common`. SQLite is unaffected.
  - Before: `let mem = limits.max_memory;`
  - After: `let mem = limits.common.max_memory;`

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.11.0...v0.12.0

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-16

### Highlights

- **`cwd` and `env` construction options for the Node and Python bindings** —
  callers can now set the starting working directory and initial environment
  directly at `Bash` construction time, instead of paying for a leading
  `cd`/`export` prelude on every run
  ([#2072](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2072)).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-11

### Highlights

- **Python custom builtins can now read and write the VFS** via a new `ctx.fs` handle on `BuiltinContext` — a Python `custom_builtins` callback gets a live, sandbox-respecting view of the interpreter's filesystem, just like the embedded `python3` builtin ([#2010](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2010)). Huge thanks to first-time external contributor **[@dedeswim](https://github.com/dedeswim)** (Edoardo Debenedetti) for designing, testing, and landing this. 🎉
- **JS ↔ Python binding parity** — the JS bindings close the remaining gaps with the Python API (`ctx.fs`, network access, `shellState`) so custom builtins behave consistently across hosts ([#2036](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2036)).
- **Real PCRE for `grep -P`** via `fancy-regex`, plus GNU long-option aliases ([#1846](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1846)).
- **Broad security & resource-safety hardening sweep** — a deep DoS/panic audit ([#2006](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2006)) plus dozens of targeted caps and budget-enforcement fixes across the interpreter, parser, and builtins (`rg`, `grep`, `awk`, `curl`, `find`, `tar`, `sqlite`, `bc`, `tr`, `iconv`), the VFS (CSPRNG random devices, lazy-materialization limits, FIFO file-count caps), streaming callbacks, and snapshot/restore.

### Contributors

Welcome and thank you to our first external contributor this cycle, **[@dedeswim](https://github.com/dedeswim)**, whose [#2010](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/2010) brings VFS access to Python custom builtins.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-02

### Highlights

- **Pyodide/Emscripten (wasm32) Python wheel** — a reduced-feature `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` Python wheel now ships, enabling the embedded Python builtin in browser/wasm hosts ([#1811](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1811)).
- **Broad resource-safety hardening sweep** — fuel/budget enforcement and memory caps across the interpreter, parser, `rg`, `sqlite`, snapshot, and expansion paths (arithmetic expansion bounds, coproc/process-substitution budgets, heredoc reinjection fuel, brace-step overflow, compound-array limits, replacement-growth caps, sqlite result memory cap).
- **JS BashTool snapshot authentication** plus keyed snapshot APIs and snapshot counter/byte-accounting fixes for correct resume.
- Benches snapshot site page and CI hardening for the release/publish workflows.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.8.0...v0.9.0

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-28

### Highlights

- **Python `open()` support** — VFS-backed `open()` / `Path.open()` read, write, and append now work in the embedded Python builtin, so LLM-generated `with open("/tmp/...")` scripts run instead of failing. Host filesystem and network stay unavailable to Python ([#1800](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1800)).
- Further `rg` parity and hardening fixes (default type globs, JSON context fanout cap, root-arg allocation) plus interpreter fixes for variable attribute/nameref persistence and persistent file descriptor validation.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.7.1...v0.7.2

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

* fix(ci): skip publish-js AI examples step on Windows + Node 24. The libuv assertion `!(handle->flags & UV_HANDLE_CLOSING)` fires during process shutdown of the example scripts on that combination only, blocking the npm publish in v0.7.0. The same scripts pass on every other platform/Node combination, so the step is gated off for `runner.os == 'Windows' && matrix.node == '24'`.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-25

### Highlights

- **Ripgrep (`rg`) parity push** — ~80 PRs landed expanding the `rg` builtin to near-feature-parity with upstream ripgrep: pcre2, multiline, encoding, glob brace/character-class/globstar, comprehensive default file types, ignore-file precedence (parent + global git ignore), preprocessor controls, hyperlink prefixes, ansi/hex colour styles, sort-by-modified, stats, max-filesize, mmap/engine flags, gzip search, follow-symlinks, and many bug fixes for output-mode precedence and binary-search behaviour.
- **Host-owned `BuiltinRegistry` API** — embedders (JS, Python, Rust) can now register and remove builtins at any point in the interpreter's lifetime via `Bash::builder().builtin_registry(...)` and `addBuiltin` / `removeBuiltin` on `Bash` / `BashTool`. Replaces the rebuild-on-register approach (which silently wiped the in-memory VFS). Brought to Python parity via `add_builtin` / `remove_builtin` ([#1721](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1721), [#1732](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1732), [#1733](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1733)).
- **VFS read-only enforcement for live mounts** — `readonly_filesystem` now reliably blocks runtime mount writes ([#1691](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1691)).
- **Maintenance pass** — turso 0.5.3→0.6.0, langchain examples to v1.x, fuzz leak-guard hardening, dependency-edge cleanup ([#1632](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1632), [#1635](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1635), [#1636](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1636), [#1639](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1639)).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-16

### Highlights

- **Continue coreutils adoption experiment** — Extends the codegen pipeline beyond `uu_app()` argument surfaces to vendor whole upstream uutils modules with a manifest and drift-detection CI. `tee`, `mktemp`, `realpath`, `stat`, and `od` now flow through codegen; `printf` runs on a vendored copy of uucore's format implementation; and `env` is ported through a virtual-env shim (TM-INF-024) ([#1592](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1592), [#1593](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1593), [#1594](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1594)).
- **MCP server mode removed from CLI** — The `bashkit mcp` server mode has been removed. The recommended path for MCP integrations is now to embed bashkit via the library bindings.
- **Security hardening across the sandbox** — Fail-closed fixes across realfs (no-follow resolver for stat/read_link/remove; reject leaf-symlink writes), snapshot/restore (atomic, fail-closed `vfs_restore`), sqlite (reject `VACUUM`/`VACUUM INTO`; row caps; engine cache invalidation), network (SSRF precheck fails closed; IPv4-mapped IPv6 normalization), jq (replace `halt` to stop sandbox escape via `process::exit`; fancy-regex execution + file-binding caps), and ssh (shell-escape sftp `ls`; try `none`-auth before password/key). The final 6 OPEN entries in the threat model are now marked mitigated ([#1568](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1568), [#1581](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1581), [#1582](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1582), [#1583](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1583), [#1584](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1584), [#1585](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1585), [#1586](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1586), [#1587](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1587), [#1588](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1588), [#1589](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1589), [#1590](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1590), [#1591](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1591), [#1599](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1599), [#1601](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1601), [#1613](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1613), [#1615](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1615)).

### Breaking Changes

- **CLI MCP server mode removed**: The `bashkit mcp` subcommand and the MCP server transport bundled in the CLI have been removed.
  - Before: `bashkit mcp --transport stdio`
  - After: embed bashkit via the library bindings (`bashkit` crate, `@everruns/bashkit` on npm, `bashkit` on PyPI) and expose tools through your own MCP server.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-06

### Highlights

- **Coreutils argument surface via codegen** — New POC pipeline ports uutils' `uu_app()` clap definitions into bashkit so builtins share the real coreutils argument shape; `cat`, `tac`, `truncate`, `shuf`, and `readlink` now flow through this surface, with a coreutils differential testing harness to catch parity drift. The codegen pipeline reads a single pinned uutils revision so generated builtins, the differential harness, and CI all agree on the upstream source of truth ([#1529](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1529), [#1535](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1535), [#1536](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1536), [#1537](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1537), [#1538](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1538), [#1542](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1542)).
- **Site updates** — Bashkit agent skill is now published on the site, alongside rustdoc guides and content signal declarations for discoverability.

### What's Changed

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-04

### Highlights

- **Fix `bashkit` v0.4.0 crates.io publish** — Move `docs/clap-builtins.md` into `crates/bashkit/docs/` (matching the rustdoc-guides convention) and update the `include_str!` path so the guide is packaged inside the crate. v0.4.0 was published to PyPI, npm, and Homebrew but the crates.io publish failed because the guide lived outside the crate directory.

### What's Changed

* fix(docs): move clap-builtins guide inside bashkit crate so cargo publish includes it by @chaliy

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-04

### Highlights

- **Builtin extension abstraction** — New public `Extension` trait groups related builtins for one-call registration on `BashBuilder`/`BashToolBuilder`. TypeScript registration now flows through `TypeScriptExtension`, and `ScriptedTool` reuses a shared `ToolDefExtension` for its per-call logic shell ([#1515](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1515), [#1518](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1518)).
- **Clap-backed custom builtins** — Custom builtins can now be defined declaratively against a `clap` parser, replacing hand-rolled arg parsing for new integrations ([#1514](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1514)).
- **SQLite session engine cache** — The `sqlite` builtin keeps a session-scoped engine alive across `exec()` calls, so transactions and prepared state survive multiple shell invocations within one session ([#1513](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1513)).
- **SQLite hardening follow-up** — PRAGMA policy parsing now handles SQL comments and quoted/bracket/backtick identifiers (closing a `PRAGMA main."cache_size"` bypass), and `max_db_bytes` is enforced consistently across VFS writes/truncates and memory-backend persistence ([#1521](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1521)).
- **Python + toolchain bumps** — Embedded Python (`monty`) bumped to `0.0.17` and Rust toolchain bumped to `1.95.0` across `rust-toolchain.toml` and matching CI workflow refs ([#1520](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1520)).

### What's Changed

* bench(sqlite): add Criterion benchmark for sqlite builtin ([#1523](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1523)) by @chaliy
* chore(python): bump monty to 49faa4c (0.0.17) and Rust to 1.95.0 ([#1520](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1520)) by @chaliy

* feat(builtins): support clap-backed custom builtins ([#1514](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1514)) by @chaliy
* test(sqlite): add differential tests vs host sqlite3 binary ([#1511](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1511)) by @chaliy

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-02

### Highlights

- **Embedded SQLite via Turso** — New `sqlite` builtin with `MemoryIO` and `VfsIO` backends, dot-commands (`.tables`, `.schema`, `.dump`), and a hardened deny list that blocks `ATTACH`/`DETACH` and dangerous `PRAGMA`s. Exposed to Python and JS bindings ([#1502](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1502), [#1507](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1507), [#1510](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1510)).
- **jq parity expansion** — Filter module restructured for parity with real jq, regex backend swapped from `regex` to `fancy-regex` for advanced patterns (lookaround, backreferences), `@tsv`/`@csv` defs and short jq-style runtime errors with cross-tool no-Debug-leak guard (TM-INF-022) ([#1501](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1501), [#1503](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1503), [#1508](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1508)).
- **Scripted-tool logic-only mode** — Orchestrator scripts can now run in a restricted "code mode" that disables shell features unrelated to control flow, narrowing the attack surface for LLM-authored scripts.
- **Python network credentials** — Phase 2 of [#1348](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1348) lands `credentials=` and `credential_placeholders=` kwargs on `Bash(network=...)`, completing the Python-side network policy surface ([#1499](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1499)).
- **Toolchain pinning** — Rust toolchain pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml` and matched in CI workflow refs to prevent same-day rustc releases from breaking CI; RSA advisory mirrored locally and dead code gated ([#1509](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1509)).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.2.1...v0.3.0

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-30

### Highlights

- **Windows mount path validation** — `MountableFs::mount` now uses `Path::has_root` instead of `Path::is_absolute`, so POSIX-style mount points like `/workspace` are accepted on every host. The v0.2.0 interop FS roundtrip test (`vfs › filesystem external roundtrip mounts into bash`) regressed silently on Windows because PR CI runs Rust tests on Linux only ([#1492](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1492)).
- **rustls switched to ring** — Replaces the `aws-lc-rs`/`aws-lc-sys` C crypto stack with pure-Rust ring across the workspace. Unblocks the aarch64 manylinux wheel build, which had failed in v0.2.0 with `'AT_HWCAP2' undeclared` from the cross-compiled `aws-lc-sys 0.39.1`. `cargo tree -i aws-lc-sys` now returns no match ([#1493](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1493)).

### What's Changed

* fix(fs): validate mount paths with POSIX semantics on Windows ([#1492](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1492)) by @chaliy
* fix(http): switch rustls crypto provider to ring ([#1493](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1493)) by @chaliy

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-30

### Highlights

- **Filesystem interop ABI** — New `bashkit::interop::fs` (behind the `interop` cargo feature) exposes a versioned `repr(C)` filesystem handle + vtable, plus Python `FileSystem.from_capsule()` / `to_capsule()` and Node `FileSystem.fromExternal()` / `toExternal()` so downstream native extensions can mount custom filesystems without sharing addon-private layouts ([#1353](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1353))
- **Python `network=` constructor kwarg** — `Bash(network=...)` now controls outbound network access at construction time, the first phase of the network policy work tracked in [#1348](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1348) ([#1489](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1489))
- **jq compatibility** — Added `input_filename` / `input_line_number` / `$ENV` stubs ([#1490](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1490)) and bounded, jq-like runtime error messages that no longer dump full input values to stderr ([#1488](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1488))

### What's Changed

* feat(jq): add input_filename / input_line_number / $ENV stubs ([#1490](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1490)) by @chaliy

* chore(deps): bump the rust-dependencies group with 5 updates ([#1483](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1483)) by @dependabot
* feat(interop): add filesystem ABI handles ([#1353](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1353)) by @chaliy

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/compare/v0.1.21...v0.2.0

## [0.1.21] - 2026-04-25

### Highlights

- **Codex security run** — Large-scale security and hardening sweep landed 100+ fixes: panic-safety across `expr`/`sed`/`sort`/`date`/`extglob`, resource limits for `local`/allexport/lazy files/`yes`/`dirstack`, depth and size caps in `jq`/`sed`/`mktemp`/snapshot restore, RealFs symlink-escape blocks, bot-auth signatures bound to method+URI, JS real-FS mount allowlist, scripted-tool injection blocks, MCP stdin bounds, `unzip` path-traversal blocks, parser timeout/input limits in WASM/`eval`/`source`/nested-bash, and credential/log redaction
- **Site and docs** — New `bashkit.sh` homepage (Astro + Cloudflare), public CLI reference rewrite, canonical `/docs` rendering, builtins index, and refreshed homepage proof and sourcing
- **External contributions** — Thanks to @oliverlambson for `BuiltinResult` support in Python custom builtins ([#1427](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1427)) and publishing Python 3.14 wheels to PyPI ([#1351](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/1351))

## [0.1.11] - 2026-03-20

### Highlights

- **Second external contribution!** Welcome @shubham-lohiya, who exposed the `Bash` class with Monty Python execution and external function handler in the Python bindings ([#760](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/760)) — making it easy to extend bashkit with custom Python functions
