# Test that dropping deeply nested containers doesn't crash (stack overflow).
# Heap::dec_ref recurses in Rust when freeing child references, so deeply
# nested containers can overflow the Rust call stack during cleanup.
# CPython handles this fine (its dealloc uses an iterative trashcan mechanism).
# Once fixed (iterative dec_ref), this should work without crashing.
