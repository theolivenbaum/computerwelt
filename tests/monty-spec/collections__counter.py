# Tests for `collections.Counter`.
#
# Every expectation here is derived from CPython 3.14. This file is dual-run
# against CPython and Monty, so both must agree exactly.
#
# NOT covered in this version (documented in limitations/collections.md):
# - `del c[key]` (the `del` statement is unimplemented Monty-wide).
# - `elements()` returns a list rather than a lazy iterator.
